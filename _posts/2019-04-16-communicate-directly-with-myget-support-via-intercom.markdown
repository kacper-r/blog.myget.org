**You spoke; we listened**

More development teams—big and small—are joining MyGet to make their package management and SDLC more efficient and secure than ever before. As so many new users have joined, we have started to hear some feedback that you would appreciate an enhanced MyGet support experience.

We heard you and are happy to announce that we’ve migrated our MyGet Customer Support processes to the Intercom platform for a seamless, efficient support experience for our amazing customers.

With the power of Intercom, you now have a direct line to communicate with MyGet’s Support Team in-app—no ticket needed! You may continue to send support questions to [support@myget.org](mailto:support@myget.org) if you prefer, or simply open the chat window that appears in the bottom right corner of the screen and ask us your questions.

The adoption of Intercom represents a key achievement in our ongoing efforts to respond to customer feedback and provide easier, more seamless support to all MyGet users. It will enable our Support Team to reduce response time and provide quicker resolution to your inquiries so your team can continue working as efficiently, effectively and securely as possible.

We will continue to support the tickets logged in the legacy system but will begin phasing these out over the next few weeks to ensure a successful transition.

Questions or concerns? Feel free to log into your MyGet account and start a chat right now! As always, please don’t hesitate to share any and all feedback with us about this release or any other features of MyGet.
